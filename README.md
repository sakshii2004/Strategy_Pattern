# Duck Simulation Program
This is a simple Java program that simulates different types of ducks and their behaviors using object-oriented design principles.

## Features
- Implements various types of ducks: RedHeadDuck, RubberDuck, MallardDuck, and DecoyDuck.
- Each duck has different behaviors for flying, quacking, and swimming.
- Uses interfaces and composition to model behaviors dynamically.
- Demonstrates the Strategy design pattern for behavior encapsulation.

## Duck Classes
### RedHeadDuck
- Displays as a RedHead Duck.
- Can fly with wings.

### DecoyDuck
- Displays as a Decoy Duck.
- Cannot fly.
- Is mute (does not quack).
- Can swim.

### Main Class
- Demonstrates the usage of each type of duck.
- Creates instances of each duck type and displays their behaviors.

## How to Use
- Compile all Java files in the project.
- Run the Main class.
- View the output in the console to see the behavior of each duck.
